Here's a simple Number Guessing Game in Python:

number_guessing_game.py

import random

def number_guessing_game():
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        try:
            # Ask the user for a guess
            guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
            attempts += 1

            if guess < 1 or guess > 100:
                print("Please guess a number between 1 and 100.")
                continue

            # Check the guess
            if guess < secret_number:
                print("Too low! Try again.")
            elif guess > secret_number:
                print("Too high! Try again.")
            else:
                print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number {secret_number} in {attempts} attempts.")
                break

        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

    print("Thanks for playing!")

if _name_ == "_main_":
    number_guessing_game()

How the Game Works:

1. The program selects a random number between 1 and 100.


2. The player guesses the number.


3. The program gives feedback: "Too low" or "Too high".


4. The game continues until the player guesses correctly.


5. Displays the number of attempts taken to win.

Run the Game:

Ensure Python is installed, then run:

python number_guessing_game.py


---

Enhancement Ideas:

Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Limit the number of attempts.

Allow the user to play again after finishing.

Display a scoreboard or high score.
